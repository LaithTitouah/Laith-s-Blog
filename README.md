# A Blog Starter App
This is a Blog app run through vite and react. It is also uses firebase to store data and autheticate the user. So when you sign in you can create articles for others to see without them being able to edit it. 
I made it somewhat unique through design with a theme of an island/ water and added some transitions with certain effects to make it look clean.
